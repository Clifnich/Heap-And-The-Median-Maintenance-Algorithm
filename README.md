# Heap And The "Median Maintenance" Algorithm

This is a project I completed while taking "Stanfordx: Algorithms Design And Analysis, Part I" on Coursera. The purpose of this project is to allow students to practice using a heap. More specifically, students were asked to compute and sum 10,000 medians as a stream of integers from 1 to 10,000 in unsorted order entered the system. 

The java codes I wrote are in the src folder.
